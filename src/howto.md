troubled times; heroes rally to causes, whether its faith, glory or riches,
besure to select the right banner to assembles the parties you deemed fit.
A banner's stats:

    1.  Points available: the total point value of recruited units
    should not surpass the banner's points available.

    2.  Starting wealth: the available gold at the start of the game.

    3.  Special rule: each banner has a specific rule to enforce on its
    units and general gameplays.

2.  Recruit units: given a banner, you should be able to filter a
list of available units. Each unit has a point value, as used to fit
within the banner's limit. <br>

3.  Spending gold on upgrades: upgrades are variance of a unit that can
be allowed to be unlocked using the starting wealth.

turn, he can opt to end it any time.
