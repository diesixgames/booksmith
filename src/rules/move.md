#Movement

To make a movement, draw a path from the unit's current location, with the
max length of the unit's base movement speed. Then the unit will move along
the drawn path.

Whenever the unit enter a terrain that is: different than the previous one
__or__ belong to the first tile away from the starting location.
Roll for movement penalty if there is any.

If the terrain have any penalty value, roll a d6 plus any bonus to that
terrain type - if the result is less than the penalty value, the unit stop
at its current location.
