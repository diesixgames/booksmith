#Control

Control is the availability of a unit to perform a specific action. When
opted for controlling, the player enter that unit's control phase.

During the control phase, the player can specify it to move, attack and/or
activate its abilities. He can choose to end the control phase any time.

The unit can only move once, and attack once during a control phase;
afterward, if it can not move or attack anymore, the control phase
automatically end.
